>I am a student in the Data Science Certificate Program here at Columbia and my undergraduate degree was in Mathematics from Fordham University.

>My previous work experience has been in the finance industry. My career started as an Intern in the Operations team at BlackRock and from there I have worked in other departments such as Investment Accounting, Expense Analysis & Budgeting and Business Analysis (and other firms such as Morgan Stanley and Allianz Global Investors). Although it is not really considered a programming language, my first exposure to programming was in Excel/Access VBA while trying to automate various processes. I am new to Python and R and look forward to learning more about data visualization.
